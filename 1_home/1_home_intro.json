  "who_we_are" : "<p>We are a bunch of multidisciplinary neuroscientists studying how the dynamics of genomes determines the brain functions throughout the multiple stages of human life in health and disease.</p>",
  "mission": "<p>Our <strong>mission</strong> is to better understand the human brain singularities and to develop breakthrough technologies bridging their implementation in the clinics and the lab. </p>",
  "how_we_do_it": " <p>To achieve our goals we use 3D tissue cultures -<strong>organoids</strong>- derived from <strong>patientâ€™s iPSC</strong> as a model. We analyze our organoids using <strong>advanced microscopy</strong>, and <strong>epigenetics and transcriptomics</strong>, boosted by customary <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> data integration.</p>"
