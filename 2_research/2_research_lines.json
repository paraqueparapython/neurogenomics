Moreover,  this approach will allow us to look for potential new drug targets that improve the imbalanced neuronal activity leading to this refractory epilepsy.</p>"

    "description": "<p>In this project we aim to ascertain the neurotropic and neurodegenerative potential of SARS-CoV-2, and to investigate the link between COVID-19 and AD risk. For this purpose, human brain organoids derived from iPSC and hESC from healthy, familial and sporadic AD, and from cognitively unimpaired adults at increased AD risk, will be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and to plasma of severe COVID-19 patients. We will characterize the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 and its connection with the development or exacerbation of neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD.</p>"

To test how organoids react to each treatment, we will implement computer vision and artificial intelligence algorithms to examine changes in the morphology and structure of each organoid, evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of drugs.</p>"
